HunspellCheckerService is a prototype of Android SpellCheckerService using Hunspell and JNI.
Unfortunately the prototype proved that Hunspell suggestions generation is too slow to be used on Android smartphones.
It takes up to few seconds to generate suggestions for a longer word.

I hope this project may save you some time if you are considering using Hunspell on Android.

Run "ndk-build" (from Android NDK) in the root project directory to compile the hunspell-jni.so shared library.
